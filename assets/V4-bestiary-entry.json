    "description": "Despite their name suggesting that they're newer than the V3 model, this is actually false. The V3 + 1 model (or for brevity, The V4 Model) is actually the result of early prototypes of the V3 model being given the AI of the V1 model, hence the name. Unlike the V3 model, which tends to prioritize cooperation, the V4 model prefers combat. However, some V4 models have been found cooperating with both eachother and V3 models. This is believed to be the result of the same, albeit unknown, process that causes opposing V3 models to cooperate.",
    "strategy": "- Their movements and combat tactics can be confusing or unpredictable; it is recommended to counteract this by employing your own erratic maneuvers.\n\n- Similar to you, they possess the ability to replenish their health by absorbing the blood of enemies or even yours. Maintaining a considerable distance is strongly recommended to thwart their self-healing.\n\n"
